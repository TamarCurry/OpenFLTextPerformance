TextEngine -> getLayoutGroups() -> getPositions(), lines 872 to 895
getPositions gets called more times than there are characters in the text field

As far as I can tell, getPositions and setFormattedPositions in the TextEngine seem to be the biggest offenders here in terms of time it takes to update after calling appendText(...).

Part of it is due to calling __context.measureText on what appears to be every single character in the text, sometimes multiple times for certain characters. It seems excessive but is understandable, since even appending even one character can alter the line count and drop a word to the next line.

I did manage to get about a 40-50% performance boost by caching the sizes of each character in an array of floats, but only under specific conditions:
	* if there were only one TextFormat for the entire TextTield AND
	* if appendText(...) was called OR
	* if multiline were toggled on/off

Outside of those specific conditions, the size cache would be cleared and old performace would return and __context.measureText is called again each time.
